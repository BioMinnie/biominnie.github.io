__ABOUT ME__

My research interests are in Microbial Genomics and bioinformatics, with a focus on the evolution and dissemination of human infectious diseases. I am particularly interested in antimicrobial resistance, mobile genetic elements and genomic epidemiology. I aim to translate my research into both clinical and public health use.

Track record
- 8 years of microbial genomics and bioinformatics research and technical experience (PhD + Postdoc)
- 21 presentations and 10 publications
- Strong data analysis skills (bioinformatics, genomic data analysis, Python and R scripting)

__CURRENT: FREELANCE RESEARCHER AND CONSULTANT__

Please get in touch if you need help with:
- Research: Comparative genomics, phylogenomics and genomic epidemiology (Microbiology)
- Technical: Genome assembly, variant calling, genome alignments, phylogenetic trees, recombination detection, _in silico_ typing, genomic data visualisation
- Preparation of lecture or communication materials (e.g. social media presence, presentations, slides, posters, blog posts, abstracts and summaries)
- Article and grant writing and editing

__EDUCATION AND RESEARCH__

During my studies I realised I could combine my two passions, computers and biology and subsequently embarked on a research career with a heavy background in next generation sequencing, genomics and bioinformatics. I have a Masters of Biotechnology, a PhD in Microbial Genomics and research experience as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Bioinformatics. 

Current research projects focus on comparative genomics, phylogenomics, genomic epidemiology and epigenomics of bacterial pathogens including Uropathogenic _Escherichia coli_ lineages and _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_.
