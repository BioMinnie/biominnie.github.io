__ABOUT ME__

My research interests are in human infectious diseases. I am particularly interested in the epidemiology, evolution, pathogenesis, antimicrobial resistance, and genomics of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens. I aim to translate my research into both clinical and public health use.

During my studies I realised I could combine my two passions, computers and biology and subsequently embarked on a research career with a heavy background in epidemiology, genomics, and bioinformatics in infectious diseases. I have a Masters of Biotechnology, a PhD in Microbial Genomics and Bioinformatics and research experience as a Postdoctoral Fellow (Microbial Genomics) and Research Fellow (Infectious Disease Epidemiology) in Australia.

------------------------
__RESEARCH__

Current research projects focus on:
- Applied and clinical epidemiology of Nontuberculous _Mycobacteria_ (NTM).
- Geospatial epidemiology of NTM infections associated with climate, weather and the environment.
- Comparative genomics and genomic epidemiology of Extraintestinal pathogenic _Escherichia coli_ (ExPEC).

Future projects:
- Genomic epidemiology of NTM with a focus on _Mycobacterium intracellulare_ and _Mycobacterium abscessus_.

Past projects:
- Genomic epidemiology of antimicrobial-resistant _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ lineages.
- Characterising surface polysaccharides and antimicrobial-resistant lineages of _Klebsiella_ spp.
- Epigenomics and Phylogenomics of ExPEC.

> Research specialties: Infectious Diseases epidemiology, Genomic Epidemiology, Microbial Genomics/Bioinformatics, Transmission Dynamics and Phylogenomics, Pathogen Evolution, Virulome and Resistome, Data Visualisation and Biostatistics. 

Track record:
- 1 year of infectious diseases epidemiology research and technical experience (Research Fellow)
- 8 years of microbial genomics, bioinformatics, and genomic epidemiology research and technical experience (PhD + Postdoc)
- 21 presentations (including 8 posters, with 6 as invited speaker).
- 8 peer reviewed publications, 3 preprints, and 3 conference abstracts published.
- Awarded <span>$</span>31,886 in grant funding and <span>$</span>5,275 in prizes.
- Strong data analysis skills (epidemiology, biostatistics, bioinformatics, genomic data analysis, Python and R scripting)
