My research interests are in Microbial Genomics, with a focus on the evolution and dissemination of human infectious diseases. I am particularly interested in antimicrobial resistance, mobile genetic elements and genomic epidemiology. I aim to translate my research into both clinical and public health use.

During my studies I realised I could combine my two passions, computers and biology and subsequently embarked on a research career with a heavy background in next generation sequencing, genomics and bioinformatics. I have a Masters of Biotechnology, a PhD in Microbial Genomics and research experience as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Bioinformatics. 

Current [research](https://biominnie.github.io/research/) projects focus on comparative genomics, phylogenomics, genomic epidemiology and epigenomics of bacterial pathogens including Uropathogenic _Escherichia coli_ lineages and _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_. In addition to research skills, I have developed many computational skills including use of Unix and Linux systems, High Performance Computing clusters and scripting skills in Python and R. I am also passionate about teaching, mentoring and science communication.

Specialties: Microbial genomics, Bioinformatics/Computational biology, Phylogenomics, Pathogen evolution, Genomic epidemiology, Antimicrobial resistance, Transmission dynamics, Virulence and pathogenesis, Data visualisation, Methylome/Epigenomics and Phylodynamics
